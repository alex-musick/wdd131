            <h2>About</h2>

            <p>Dumb Calendar allows you to simply write a note in whatever format you'd like, and have that note appear on the day that you have associated it with. Store relevant to-do lists, itineraries, reminders, or whatever other text you want.</p>

            <div class="faq-question">
                <h2 class="faq-title">Why would I want this?</h2>
                <p class="hidden">Most calendar applications are built around tasks or events that fit into specific slots of time. This does not fully reflect everything that somebody might write on a paper calendar. By allowing the user to simply type whatever they want, more flexibility is afforded while also making the software easier to use.</p>

            <div class="faq-question">
                <h2 class="faq-title">Why did you make this?</h2>
                <p class="hidden">I made this as my final project for the class WDD 131: Dynamic Web Fundamentals at BYU-Idaho.</p>

                <h2 class="faq-title">Does Dumb Calendar store my data online?</h2>
                <p class="hidden">No. Your data is stored entirely on your local computer.</p>

            <div class="faq-question">
                <h2 class="faq-title">Can I switch computers or web browsers and keep my calendar?</h2>
                <p class="hidden">Maybe. If your new web browser or computer allows you to migrate your web browser data, then your calendar *might* be able to migrate with it. However, there is no way to export your data directly.</p>
